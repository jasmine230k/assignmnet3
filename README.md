What were you trying to build?
I was trying to build a personal portfolio website with five pages using HTML and Bootstrap.

Who is it for, and what problem does it solve?
It’s for anyone who wants to know more about me—like instructors or future clients. It shows what I can do and my design style.

What tools or technologies did you choose?

HTML / CSS

Bootstrap

What did you already know going in, and what were your assumptions?
I already had some knowledge of HTML and CSS. I assumed it would be easy to just build the pages one by one, but it took more time than I expected to make everything look good.



What did you build first, and why?
I started with the homepage because it sets the base for all other pages and it’s the first impression.


What went smoothly?
The navbar and layout using Bootstrap went smooth. I had already practiced it before so that helped.


What challenges did you encounter?
I wasn’t sure what to put in the “projects” page because I don’t have much of my own work yet. But I came up with ideas like a moodboard and a resource page which turned out nice.


What did you learn or change as you went?
I learnt how to reuse components like navbar and footer on all pages. I also got more confident using Bootstrap classes without getting confused.

What does the final product do?
It shows who I am, what I offer, and what inspires me—even without real projects.


What are you proud of?
I’m proud of how clean the layout looks and the color theme I chose.


What would you improve or refactor given more time?
I would maybe add animations or a real projects section once I have more work to show.


How does this project connect to your next steps?
It’s a good starting point for my future portfolio. Later I can just update the same site with real projects.
